        "\n",
        "A Decision Tree is a machine learning algorithm that makes decisions by splitting data into smaller groups based on feature values. It works like a flowchart with branches.\n",
        "\n",
        "In classification:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The tree starts at the root node (the whole dataset).\n",
        "\n",
        "- It selects the best feature to split the data (using criteria like Gini impurity or entropy).\n",
        "\n",
        "- The data is divided into branches based on the selected feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "- This process continues until the tree reaches leaf nodes, where a final class label is assigned.\n",

        "- It separates the classes better\n",
